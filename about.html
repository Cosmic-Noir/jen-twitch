                device of J-fer, gaming extradoinaire, and to provide
                practice in web development for the creater, her sister.

            <h3 class="saying"><i>Mother of one, slayer of many.</i></h3>
            <p class="aboutText">Gaming since childhood, J-fer gravitated
                towards first-person shooters on her PS4. What began as a 
                few matches a night to blow off steam soon became a competative
                past time. Relishing her kill-death ratios, J-fer began
                snap chatting shots of her records. It was not long after
                this that her sister began to bed her to start streaming.

            <p class="aboutText">Since debuting on April 24th, 2019, it did not
                take J-fer long to climb the ranks of popular Twitch streamers.
                On her first night, having never streamed before, but drinking a 
                Bud Light and filling the air with laughter, J-fer garnered an 
                audiance of over 200 hundred viewers by the time she was finished.

                <p class="aboutText">Always interested in makeup and with a love
                    for Haloween, J-fer was incredibly surprised at the opportunities
                    to <i>create</i> things on her stream. Soon she was not only
                    streaming killing-streaks, but theatrical horror and everyday 
                    make-up routines due to their popular demand.
